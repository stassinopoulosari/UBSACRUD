# Bell Schedule App: UBSACRUD
**Ari Stassinopoulos**

## what is this?
This is an administrator interface for the [DHS Bell Schedule App](https://github.com/stassinopoulosari/dhsbellschedule-ios).
The interface allows me to keep the schedule up to date and push updates to user devices. It also allows me to configure additional schedule behaviour without
manually updating the mobile app.

## why?
The [previous administrator interface](https://github.com/stassinopoulosari/UBSA-admin) was written over a very short amount of time for a school project
and was annoying to use regularly. I also wanted to use this project as an opportunity to explore parts of JavaScript which I had not used
in the past, including ES6 modules and Objects, as well as to try and replicate UI patterns I would normally use a library for.

## what is the technology?

This CRUD system is written in HTML and JavaScript and interfaces with a Firebase backend.

## what does the UI look like?

I aimed for a minimalist UI to focus on the user experiene over the aesthetics and to match the Web Brutalism I attempted to embody with [my website](https://ari-s.com).
